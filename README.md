# TruthFinder: Detecting Fake News With Machine Learning
## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a given news article is fake or real. With the increasing prevalence of misinformation and fake news on social media platforms and news websites, detecting fake news has become a critical task to ensure the dissemination of accurate information to the public.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Fake News classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification). It includes information about news heading, content and Label that indicates whether news artical is fake or real.
## Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the text data by removing noise, tokenizing, and performing other necessary text processing steps.
## Feature Extraction
Extract relevant features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings.
## Model Training
Train machine learning models using the preprocessed text data and labeled examples to learn patterns and make predictions.
## Conclusion
The Fake News Prediction Project aims to develop a reliable machine learning model for identifying fake news articles based on their content. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and promote the dissemination of accurate information in the digital age.
